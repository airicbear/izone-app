## Known Issues

### Web version

The Web version is *very* much not well supported.

1. Embedded Youtube videos don't work (see the [flutter_widget_from_html](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_widget_from_html) package).

2. Cached network images don't work (see the [cached_network_image](https://pub.dev/packages/cached_network_image) package).

3. The most useful thing about the Web version is to share the app with others using a link.

The app might actually be better off using Image assets rather than cached network images, at least for pages such as the `AboutPage` and `MembersPage`.

### App layout

There is an issue with the [`PageController`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/PageController-class.html) going beyond the last page when the [`LayoutBuilder`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/LayoutBuilder-class.html) switches from vertical to horizontal layout.
This might be a bug concerning the use of [`CustomScrollView`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/CustomScrollView-class.html) under a [`PageView`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/PageView-class.html), I'm not exactly sure.
It may be worth checking out the [`SliverLayoutBuilder`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SliverLayoutBuilder-class.html) class.

### Embedded Youtube video (Android)

The audio from the embedded Youtube video persists if the app is not closed and the user decides to go out of the app or turns off their display.
I figure this may be more of a feature than a bug, though, potentially allowing for Youtube streaming without ads.

**WARNING:** There is something *SEVERELY* wrong with the embedded Youtube videos that cause the Android device to be COMPLETELY borked. I'm trying to fix this ASAP.

## Developer Notes

I initially tried using SQLite hence the `assets/izoneapp.db` but then exported it to `assets/izone.json` after realizing how much easier it would be to just use JSON.
I'm keeping this method of editing the `.db` file and exporting to `.json` in case I want to use SQL in the future.
